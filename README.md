# IEC Investor Matching
For my Break Through Tech Fellowship, I worked with International Elite Capital to create an AI-powered Investor Matching platform that companies can utilized to target investors to accelerate their progress and innovation.

After doing preliminary data preparation from Excel files and SEC files, we came to a base structure for our training dataset to use and reproduce results on a larger scale, to help more compnaies grow their business.

### How to run it on your own machine
I recommend using a virtual machine to run this streamlit.

1. Install the requirements

   ```
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
